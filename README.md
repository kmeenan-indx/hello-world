Hi! My name is Kendall Meenan. I am a software engineer who graduated from Northeastern University with a degree in Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. C++ and Java are my strongest languages currently. In my free time, I like to read, go to Red Sox games at Fenway, and hang out with my friends.ðŸ¤ âš¾
